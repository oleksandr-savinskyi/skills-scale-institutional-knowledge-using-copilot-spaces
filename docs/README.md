# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

OctoAcme follows an iterative, customer-first approach to project delivery across all cross-functional initiatives. Projects move through a defined lifecycle—**Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Close & Retrospective**—ensuring each stage produces clear artifacts and decisions before advancing. Core guiding principles include delivering customer value early and often, maintaining clear ownership with a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Manager (PdM), making data-informed decisions, and fostering psychological safety so every team member can contribute and learn without fear.

Each project is staffed with well-defined roles: the **Project Manager** coordinates schedules, risks, and cross-team communications; the **Product Manager** owns the product vision, backlog prioritization, and success metrics; **Developers** implement and test features to meet acceptance criteria; **QA/Testing** validates quality and the definition of done; and **Stakeholders** provide direction and approvals. Key artifacts produced throughout the lifecycle include a Project Charter, Roadmap, Sprint Backlog, Acceptance Criteria, and a Risk Register, all of which are kept up to date in the project repository.

Communication at OctoAcme is structured and consistent: the PM and PdM hold a weekly sync to align on priorities and blockers, the delivery team runs twice-weekly standups, and stakeholders receive monthly status updates supplemented by ad-hoc escalations when needed. Risks are tracked in a shared Risk Register, assessed by impact and likelihood, and reviewed at every weekly sync. When issues arise, a clear escalation path—team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor—keeps decisions moving without ambiguity, and security incidents follow a dedicated runbook.

Quality is built into every phase rather than bolted on at the end. Developers write and maintain tests alongside features, code reviews enforce standards, and QA validates acceptance criteria before each release. After every sprint or significant milestone, the team holds a retrospective to capture what went well and what needs improvement, converting top learnings into tracked action items. This continuous improvement loop, combined with blameless post-incident reviews, ensures that OctoAcme's practices evolve alongside its products.
